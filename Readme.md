SEIU Metrics Calculator

Description

The SEIU Metrics Calculator is a web application created during SEIU's first internal hackathon in 2015. The core purpose was to empower local unions by providing a simple, self-service tool to generate a clear, quantitative snapshot of their organizational health, akin to displaying essential financial ratios.

This tool was specifically designed to enable local union staff—particularly those with new or developing technical skillsets—to easily calculate and track critical organizational metrics compared to the overall size of their "Universe."

Features

The application calculates and provides percentages for key metrics to help Locals establish baselines and monitor trends for membership, political, and communication drives.

Key metrics tracked include:

Dues Payers (full and partial)

Agency Fee Payers

Member Card Signers

Political Contribution Card Signers

Political Contribution Payers

Contact Data Saturation (email, SMS, physical addresses)

Key Project Benefits

Local Control: The information is for the Local's internal use and is not automatically shared with the International or other Locals.

Unlimited Access: Any authorized staff from the Local can access and use the calculator as many times as needed.

Trending Baseline: While data saving is a future goal, the tool immediately helps establish a reliable baseline, with a provided Google spreadsheet resource for manual trend tracking.

Contributions are greatly appreciated to help enhance this tool for Locals.
