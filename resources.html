                                  It can help you easily see an overview of the health of your Local as it pertains to dues, agency fee payers, membership cards signed, political signers, political payers and contact data compared to the size of your universe. It can help you get a baseline and watch trending for membership card drives, dues audits, political drives, email and sms authorization drives. Also ANYONE from your Local can calculate data as many times as they want. No limits to number of people accessing nor times accessed.
                              </div>

                                  No. This tool is a way for any size Local to quickly tabulate counts and percentages at the local level. It is private and not stored or shared. In the future we would like to add capabilities for Locals to save certain data for trending analysis.

                                  You may have Members who have signed a card who have not yet or never paid dues. They could be new hires, members on extended leaves or the boss for whatever reason is not submitting dues payments to you even though you have a signed card on file.

                                  The Calculator is a web-based online tool that gives SEIU Locals the ability to plug in numbers regarding dues, membership, political contributions and contact information and receive calculations real time. All staff from each SEIU Local can access the calculator. There is no limit to the amount of staff who can sign in at a time and no limit to the amount of times they access the calculator. The Information typed in is not shared automatically with the International nor any other Local.
                              </div>

                              <div class="well well-lg">
                                  <div>
                                      We're facing more and more challenges at each Local; right to work, assaults from anti-union groups and legal challenges. For instance, the Supreme Court is currently considering a case that would limit our ability to collect dues from our public sector union members on a national scale. It's always a good idea to take a quick look at how your Local is doing in regards to dues/partial payers, membership cards signed and political contributions/payers.This will help you assess financial health and political power.

                                      We need to stay in touch with our Members constantly to keep them informed and engaged; via mail, email, phone and text. In some Locals we are even able to sign Members up and sign up political contributions via mail, email and home/cell phone. Therefore it's helpful to know the percentage of Members you have the ability to reach out to using these different methods.

                                      Get your total numbers from your dues database/spreadsheets, Finance or Data personnel or bargaining unit/employer lists. You can then type in the data for any calculations you want to see.

                                      For example, let's say you want to know what percentage of dues and partial payers you have along with how many of your political card signers are paying political contributions. Just type in your Universe numbers, your total full dues payers, your total partial dues payers, how many members have signed political cards and how many members are paying political contributions. Once you have scrolled through each of the pages, you can hit "Skip" when you get to the CONTACT page and just hit "Submit", then your summary will appear.
                                  </div>

                                      If you do not care about a particular data calculation you can always put zeroes for those fields. For example, let's say you only want to know CONTACT percentages for your membership. You would enter the total number in your Universe, then just type in zeroes in the dues, membership card and political fields, then again type in your member totals when you get to the Contact page. You would then hit "Generate Report" to receive your summary.
